# Emergence in complex systems

Project made during the course **TP09 Emergence in Complex Systems** held by professor **Jean-Louis Dessalles** ([personal homepage](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/jld/jld.html)) in [**TelecomParis**](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)

### Course overview

The emergence of sociality is crucial, not only to understand animal and human societies, but also to gain a new insight into many aspects of the digital life (social media, open-source software communities, Internet technical forums, cooperation among artificial agents, human-computer verbal interaction, acceptability of AI).

This course will explore the conditions for stable social behaviour. You will be using computer simulations to study various phenomena (cooperation, coordination, sharing, collective problem solving, communication, charity). You will manipulate several theoretical models (including kin selection, reciprocity and social signalling) that are used to explain these phenomena.

### EVOLIFE

**Evolife** has been developed to study various evolutionary phenomena:
- Genetic algorithms
- Natural evolution and behavioural ecology

It is written in Python and should thus run on various platforms. The source code is in `Evolife/`. This software was written by professor Jean-Louis Dessalles: [here](https://evolife.telecom-paris.fr) latest version.
